# papers

In this repository are the sumamries of the papers I have read for my courseworks and projects. 

Most of the papers are focused on deep learning and reinforcement learning.

## DRL Methods
- [Human-level Control Through Deep Reinforcement Learning](Human-level_Control_Through_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning.md)
- [Policy Gradient Methods for Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation](Policy_Gradient_Methods_for_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Function_Approximation.md)
- [Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms](Deterministic_Policy_Gradient_Algorithms.md)
- [Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms](Proximal_Policy_Optimization_Algorithms.md)
- [Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning](Continuous_Control_with_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning.md)

## DRL + Portfolio Management
- [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automated Stock Trading: An Ensemble Strategy](Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Automated_Stock_Trading:_An_Ensemble_Strategy.md)
- [A Deep Q-learning Portfolio Management Framework for the Cryptocurrency Market](A_Deep_Q-learning_Portfolio_Management_Framework_for_the_Cryptocurrency_Market.md)
- [Cryptocurrency Portfolio Management with Deep Reinforcement Learning](Cryptocurrency_Portfolio_Management_with_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning.md)
