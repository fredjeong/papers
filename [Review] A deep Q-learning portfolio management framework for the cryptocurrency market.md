# A deep Q-learning portfolio management framework for the cryptocurrency market

# 1. Introduction

Deep RL has been applied to the definition of intelligent agents for automated financial trading. The process of trading is represented as an online decision making problem that concerns two critical steps of market condition summarisation and optimal action execution.

In portfolio management, an agent or a set of agents should continuously reallocate an amount of fund into a number of different financial assets with the final aim of maximising the return and minimising the risk.
